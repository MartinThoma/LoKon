			ORDERING FROM INSIDE GERMANY ONLY
			=================================

Persons in Germany wishing to order shareware may also transfer funds
into our account with Deutsche Bank.   Once the money is deposited you
may either fax a confirmation to us with proof of deposit or wait until
Deutsche Bank notifies us of the transaction (usually 10-18 business days).
Account information is as follows:

Deutsche Bank / Frankfurt Branch
Empfänger:  Thomas Bradford / BMT Micro
Konto-Nummer: 0860221
Bankleitzahl: 500-700-10

When you make the transfer, be sure to put your name and the program you
are registering on the transfer.

Current exchange rates can be obtained by sending an email to
dm_to_us@bmtmicro.com.   An automated reply will return todays exchange
rates.

It is very important that you send us a completed order form by
either email or fax if you deposit money into this account for a
registration.  Fill the order form out as usual except in the credit
card number field put "DEUTSCHE BANK".   We will file the order and
use it to match against the deposit information we receive from the
bank.

				IMPORTANT!

When you email us your order form, we will reply with an
acknowledgement.   If you do not get an acknowledgement within 24 hours
please send your order again in case it was lost.  This extra bit of
caution can save a lot of confusion.

If you are concerned that your order is taking too long to process, feel
free to check with us about the status of your order.   It's important
to all of us that you feel safe doing business with our company and
please feel free to suggest ways we can improve our service to you.
